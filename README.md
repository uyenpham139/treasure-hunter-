# TREASURE HUNTER

## üìù Description

This is a 2D side-scrolling platformer built with Pygame. It features a playable character, multiple enemy types, collectibles, a boss battle, and a complete, built-in level editor.

## üìå Features

- Level Editor: A fully functional, in-game level editor. Create, save, and play your own levels.

- Game States: A robust state machine manages the Main Menu, Level Editor, main game (Level), and End Screen.

- Player Mechanics: Run, jump, attack and air attack (jump + attack). Includes a health system, invincibility frames, and an inventory.

### Diverse Enemies:

- Spikes: Simple static hazards.

- Tooth: A walking, patrolling enemy that chases the player on sight.

- Shell: A stationary turret enemy that shoots pearl projectiles.

- Crabby (Boss): A boss enemy with a large health bar, dedicated boss area, and multiple AI states (idle, run, attack, return to origin).

### Items & Inventory:

- Collect three types of coins (gold, silver, diamond).

- Pick up items: health potions, keys, and checkpoint maps.

- Toggle a simple 3-slot inventory to use items.

### Menus:

- Main Menu: Start a new game, enter the editor, or quit.

- Options Menu: A pausable in-game menu (and main menu screen) to adjust music and SFX volume.

### Dynamic World:

    - You must place a 'player' tile (from the 'object' menu) for the level to work.

    - Place some 'terrain' tiles for the player to stand on.
